            <h3>Valorant</h3>
            <p>Valorant is a team-based first-person tactical hero shooter set in the near future. Players play as one
                of a set of Agents, characters based on several countries and cultures around the world. In the main
                game mode, players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having five
                players on it. Agents have unique abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate
                ability that requires charging through kills, deaths, orbs, or objectives. Every player starts each
                round with a "classic" pistol and one or more "signature ability" charges. Other weapons and ability
                charges can be purchased using an in-game economic system that awards money based on the outcome of the
                previous round, any kills the player is responsible for, and any objectives completed. The game has an
                assortment of weapons including secondary guns like sidearms and primary guns like submachine guns,
                shotguns, machine guns, assault rifles, and sniper rifles. There are automatic and semi-automatic
                weapons that each have a unique shooting pattern that has to be controlled by the player to be able to
                shoot accurately. It currently offers 24 agents to choose from. The player will get 5 unlocked agents
                when they create their account, and will have to unlock the rest of the agents by collecting an in-game
                currency called Kingdom Credits. Kingdom Credits can be acquired by playing games or completing daily
                and weekly tasks, and can be spent on unlocking new agents or cosmetic items.</p>
